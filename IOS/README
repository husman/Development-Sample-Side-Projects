This is a enterprise mobile application I worked on for Dressler LLC.

NOTE: This is just a fraction of the whole application.

The original deadline for completion was 3 weeks from the start date.
However, the deadline was changed to just 4 days.

Originally, I had designed a great model to develop this application on, however,
the vision took a sharp turn when pressed against a very short/sudden deadline change.

This project started out so fun but became a hack-job :(
