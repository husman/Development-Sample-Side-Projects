I started this project while working for the Hunter College, Research Foundation of CUNY.
This is an application used daily by multiple tutors, teachers, and students to teacher/learn.

I was also working on a full LAMP Stack Course Management System at the same time and spent
most of my time working on the Course Management System. This application took me about 3 
and a half weeks to develop. The application began to incorporate several hacks that were
applied during Hot Patches :(.

Files I Wrote:
	+ LiveClassroom/LiveClassroom.mxml
	+ LiveClassroom/org (everything in this directory)
	
This application was integrated with the Course Management System through PHP.
