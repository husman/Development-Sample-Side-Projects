This is the beginning stages of a programming language I am writing
called Unic. Unic stands for "Universal-C". I would like to merge 
the C programming language with Java in a convention similar to 
how you write web applications in HTML. You can insert JavaScript
between the <Script> tag and CSS between the <STYLE> tag.
