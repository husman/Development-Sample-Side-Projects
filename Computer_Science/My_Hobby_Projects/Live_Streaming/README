Experimental Projects:
	- P2P_Live_Streaming 
		Something I began working on for fun when I became interested in the P2P
		Technology Adobe introduced into the Flash Media Server. I did some research
		into Skype as well and here is a quick project I put together while experimenting.
		
	- P2P_Simple_Speex 
		After receiving some complaints about delay in a Live Classroom application I created,
		I became more interested in Speex, which was the audio encoder used by my Flex Application.
		
	- PixieHD
		While working on a gaming website with a few friends, I became interested in streaming
		my games live. This led me to the FFMPEG group and multiple other interesting video/audio
		groups. These are some of the experimental programs I created while investigating the concept.
