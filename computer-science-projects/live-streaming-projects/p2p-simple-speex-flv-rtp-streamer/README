Experimental program: rtp_wave_client.c:
	I wrote a small Wave decoder (see my Wave project) which decodes a selected wave file.
	The wave file is streamed via RTP using the oRTP library to a server. The RTP is over UDP.

Experimental program: rtp_wave_speex_client.c:
	You can select a wave file and it will be decoded and encoded into speex then sent 
	over to a server.

Experimental program: rtp_wave_speex_server.c:
	Experimental server for the rtp_wave_speex_client.

Experimental program: rtp_flv_client.c:
	Most of my live streaming professional work was done with Adobe Flex/Flash Media Server.
	The FLV format interest me as a result. This is an experimental program to stream FLV
	files with Speex audio.
